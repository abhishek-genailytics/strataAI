# Requirements Document

## Introduction

StrataAI is a unified API gateway platform that provides developers with a single interface to access multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) while offering comprehensive observability, usage monitoring, and cost tracking. The platform includes an interactive playground for testing models and a dashboard for monitoring usage patterns and costs across different providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely register and authenticate with the platform, so that I can safely manage my AI provider credentials and track my usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL provide registration and login functionality
2. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create a secure account using Supabase authentication
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using JWT tokens
4. WHEN a user accesses their data THEN the system SHALL enforce row-level security to ensure users only see their own information
5. IF a user session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 2: API Key Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely store and manage API keys for multiple AI providers, so that I can use different models without exposing my credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds an API key THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store it securely in Supabase
2. WHEN a user views their API keys THEN the system SHALL display masked versions for security
3. WHEN a user updates an API key THEN the system SHALL validate the key with the provider before saving
4. WHEN a user deletes an API key THEN the system SHALL remove it permanently and confirm the action
5. IF an API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL notify the user and prevent its use

### Requirement 3: Unified API Gateway

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to make API calls through a single endpoint regardless of the AI provider, so that I can switch between models without changing my integration code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes an API request THEN the system SHALL route it to the correct provider using LangChain abstractions
2. WHEN selecting a model THEN the system SHALL automatically determine the appropriate provider
3. WHEN making provider calls THEN the system SHALL use the user's stored API keys
4. WHEN a provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement backoff strategies and notify the user

### Requirement 4: Usage Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track my API usage across all providers, so that I can monitor my consumption patterns and optimize my costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call is made THEN the system SHALL log the request details including tokens used, response time, and provider
2. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL use current provider pricing models
3. WHEN storing usage data THEN the system SHALL include timestamps for time-based analysis
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging
5. IF usage exceeds defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL alert the user

### Requirement 5: Observability Dashboard

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to visualize my usage patterns and costs through an interactive dashboard, so that I can make informed decisions about my AI model usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display usage metrics by provider, model, and time period
2. WHEN analyzing costs THEN the system SHALL show cost breakdowns and trends over time
3. WHEN filtering data THEN the system SHALL allow users to select specific date ranges and providers
4. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL provide interactive visualizations for better insights
5. IF no data exists THEN the system SHALL display helpful onboarding messages

### Requirement 6: Interactive Playground

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test different AI models through a web interface, so that I can experiment with various providers and compare their responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the playground THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown to select available providers and models
2. WHEN composing requests THEN the system SHALL offer a user-friendly interface for input parameters
3. WHEN receiving responses THEN the system SHALL display them in a readable format with syntax highlighting
4. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL save the history for easy replay and comparison
5. IF a request fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and suggested fixes

### Requirement 7: Rate Limiting and Caching

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to implement rate limiting and caching, so that the system remains stable and performs well under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users make requests THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limits using Redis
2. WHEN identical requests are made THEN the system SHALL serve cached responses when appropriate
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 status with retry information
4. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL respect provider-specific caching policies
5. IF cache storage is full THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction policies

### Requirement 8: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my API keys and usage data to be secure, so that I can trust the platform with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing API keys THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all communications
3. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens for authentication
4. WHEN logging requests THEN the system SHALL not store sensitive data in plain text
5. IF a security breach is detected THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate incident response procedures
